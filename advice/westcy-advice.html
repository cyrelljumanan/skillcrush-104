			<h4>Your timing is different than anbody else's</h4>
      <p>Whether you are just starting out or you have been around for a while, it takes time and a pace that is relevant to you to master this. Stay focused on what you are doing and how you are making progress. Do not worry if other people are learning and getting things done faster. Coding is a big learning curve that is different for each inidividual. </p>
      <h4>Drop the Imposter Syndrome</h4>
      <p>It hard to do it, but this is where you have to have faith in yourself. NO matter what you say, you are highly capable of accompishing the skill of coding. Does not matter what background you come or how logically skilled you are. You are who you are and this is capable. </p>
